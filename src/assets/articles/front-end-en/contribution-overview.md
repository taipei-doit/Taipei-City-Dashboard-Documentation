## Why Contribute

As the Taipei City Dashboard transitions from an internal tool to a public platform, we hope that it can better meet the needs of citizens and policy makers in both Taipei and New Taipei City. This is also why we decided to release it while the project is still under development.

By contributing to this project, youâ€™ll have a say in how Taipei City Dashboard 3.0 looks and functions. This is also a great opportunity to directly interact with Taipei City Government and TUIC. Your contributions will also be attributed to all relevant components for everyone to see.

## Become a Contributor

This project welcomes any contributions. We manage all of our contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/tpe-doit/Taipei-City-Dashboard) through issues and pull requests.

Contributions are classified into the following two types: bug reports and feature requests. These contribution types will be explained in greater detail in this [later article](/front-end/open-an-issue).

You may suggest changes by opening an issue on GitHub. If we approve the change, you may either choose to let us proceed with the development, or choose to implement the change yourself and then open a pull request when you are finished.
